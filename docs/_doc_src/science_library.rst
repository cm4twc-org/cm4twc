===============

The modularity of `unifhy` allows for different combinations of
components to be used to close the terrestrial water and nutrient cycles. Below is a
list of the alternative science (i.e. alternative processes) that can
be used for each compartment of the terrestrial and nutrient water cycles.
Please note that the components for the nutrient cycle are still in development.
