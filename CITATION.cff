abstract: >-
  The Python package unifhy (Unified Framework for
  Hydrology) is a hydrological modelling framework which
  combines interchangeable modelling components for the
  surface layer, subsurface, and open water parts of the
  terrestrial water cycle. By two-way coupling these three
  components, the framework provides a fully functional
  model for simulating the terrestrial water cycle. It is
  designed to foster collaborations between land surface,
  hydrological, and groundwater modelling communities by
  structuring their interactions around standardised
  interfaces between the components.
